/* Pin Connections/Functionality
Currently the car has 3 toggle switches to control the RGB lights
The LED strips are all in parallel so we will treat them as one set each

My reccomendation is that the 3 switches act as a 3bit binary input code

000 = Off
001 = Red
010 = Green
011 = Blue
100 = Red+Green
101 = Red+Blue
110 = Green+Blue
111 = WildStyle

Pin09 = Red Wire
Pin10 = Green Wire
Pin11 = Blue Wire
GND = GND

Pin08 = Switch 1
Pin12 = Switch 2
Pin13 = Switch 3
